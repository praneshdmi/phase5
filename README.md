A front-end web app that displays live stock prices and updates in real-time using financial APIs. It helps users monitor market trends instantly with an interactive and responsive interface.

⚙️ Features:
Real-time stock updates, search bar for stock symbols, interactive charts, responsive design, and live price animation.

💻 Technologies Used:
React.js, Chart.js, WebSocket, Axios, Tailwind CSS, and Finnhub/Alpha Vantage API.

🧩 Challenges and Solutions:
Handled real-time data flow using React Hooks and Context API, optimized UI re-renders with React.memo(), and overcame API rate limits through caching and throttling.
